# 🧠 Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy)

This project is a beginner-friendly neural network built **completely from scratch using NumPy**, without any deep learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

It includes:
- Manual implementation of dense layers
- ReLU and softmax activation functions
- Categorical cross-entropy loss
- Modular files for better understanding of internal components
